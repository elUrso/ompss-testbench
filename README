#Test bench

This container is intended to remove the needs to install libraries and other files in order to run benchmarks form the taskdep-suit.

To use it just create a folder named src and add your benchmarks there.

You shall clone the benchmarks into src/taskdep-suit

Utilize `update.sh` to update the image and `run.sh` to test it.

The bench comands shall be used inside the benchmark folder.

The structure of the container is:

/src <- files are copied here

$suit_root
    /conf <- configuration file
    /c    <- bench api folder
    /group
        /benchmark
        ...
    ...

The commands to use bench are:

bench build  - Build the project
bench run    - Run it and generate jsons
bench export - Get machine information and export csv

The conf file is not yet used by all the benchmarks, but it should hold the prefix configurations to make your life easier in cross-compiling and testing special flags for optimization.
